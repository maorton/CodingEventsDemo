# CodingEventsDemo

This app is designed to keep track of upcoming coding events. 

Currently, the app gives information about each specific event, such as date, category, and event details. It also allows the user to add, edit, and delete events.

In the future I would like to add a person class to allow the user to update which events they are attending to make it more specific to themselves.
